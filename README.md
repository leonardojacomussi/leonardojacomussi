### Hi there! 👋🏾

I'm Leonardo Jacomussi, I'm 28 years old and I'm an Software Engineer at [@Harmonia-Global][harmonia] in São Paulo, SP - Brazil.

My interest in development arose during my graduation, when many of the engineering and digital signal processing solutions were implemented in Matlab.

At the end of the course, the development phase of a graduation project, I developed a SLM (Sound Level Meter) in Python using a Raspberry Pi and other hats that made up the system (see [PySLM][pyslm]). Since then my interest in programming has only increased. Today, at the company I work for, I am part of an Innovation team, where I have the freedom to implement new solutions.

Currently I'm interested in Python for embedded systems, web frontend, mobile and cloud development, to develop IoT solutions.
